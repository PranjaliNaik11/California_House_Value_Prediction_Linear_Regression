# California Housing Data Analysis and House Value Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview:
This Python project aims to analyze California housing data and predict house values using linear regression. The dataset used for this project is the California housing dataset, which contains various features such as median income, housing median age, average rooms, etc., for different districts in California. The goal is to build a linear regression model that can accurately predict the median house value for a given set of features.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the California housing dataset. It can be found in the `california_housing.csv` file in the `data` directory. The dataset contains the following features:
- Median Income
- Housing Median Age
- Average Rooms
- Average Bedrooms
- Population
- Average Occupancy
- Latitude
- Longitude

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring the data)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PranjaliNaik11/California_House_Value_Prediction_Linear_Regression.git
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Python script `CaliforniaHousing.py` to perform the necessary tasks.

## Instructions
1. Explore the dataset to understand the features and their relationships.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling features, etc.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train a linear regression model using the training data.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. Tune hyperparameters if necessary to improve the model's performance.
7. Make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model's performance.
8. Interpret the results and draw conclusions.
